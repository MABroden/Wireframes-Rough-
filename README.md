Discussion 3 Wireframes

Wireframing is an essential step in mobile app development that creates low-fidelity diagrams outlining an app's structure, interfaces, information architecture, and user flows. Wireframes serve as blueprints that focus the design on core features and user needs. Iterating wireframes enables quick feedback before high-fidelity designs, while detailed wireframes break down requirements for development planning. Overall, wireframing keeps users at the heart of the design process and is crucial when developing my Liberty Buddy app to define the user experience, support planning, and maintain a user-centered approach.
